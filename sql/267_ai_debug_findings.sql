-- AI Debug Findings - The Real Issue
-- 
-- After examining the database schema and current state, here's what I found:

-- 1. NO AI PLAYERS EXIST
-- The database has 0 players and 0 AI players
SELECT 'Current player count' as status, COUNT(*) as count FROM players
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Current AI player count' as status, COUNT(*) as count FROM ai_players;

-- 2. NO UNIVERSES EXIST  
-- The database has 0 universes
SELECT 'Current universe count' as status, COUNT(*) as count FROM universes;

-- 3. AI SYSTEM NOT IMPLEMENTED
-- The players table does NOT have is_ai or ai_personality columns
-- The ai_player_memory table does NOT exist
-- The cron_run_ai_actions function does NOT exist

-- 4. WHAT EXISTS vs WHAT'S EXPECTED
SELECT 'What exists in schema:' as category, 'ai_players table (legacy)' as item
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What exists in schema:', 'ai_ranking_history table (legacy)'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'is_ai column in players table'
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'ai_personality column in players table'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'ai_player_memory table'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'cron_run_ai_actions function'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'run_enhanced_ai_actions function'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'What is missing:', 'All AI action functions (ai_make_decision, etc.)';

-- CONCLUSION:
-- The enhanced AI system was never actually implemented in the database.
-- The migrations (197-266) were created but never run.
-- The current database only has the legacy ai_players table from the original system.
-- 
-- TO FIX THIS:
-- 1. Run all the AI migration files (197-266) to create the enhanced AI system
-- 2. Create a universe 
-- 3. Create AI players using the new system
-- 4. Then the cron job will have AI players to act on
